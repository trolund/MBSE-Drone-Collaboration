# Model-Based Systems Engineering - Simulating a futuristic package delivery service using drones.

This project have been done as a part of the course 02223 - Model-Based Systems Engineering at DTU in the Fall of 2022

# Ideas to investigate 

* speed of truck 
    How fast will the truck be able to drive through the streets?
    Is this practical? - will it interrupt the "normal" traffic too much?
* Optimize order of packages fetched from truck
* Optimize flying patch of drone
* Optimize with delivering multiple packages at one time. (in container (task))
* Multiple drones lifting heavy packages.
